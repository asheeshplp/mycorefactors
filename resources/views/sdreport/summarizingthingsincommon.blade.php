				To further help clarify your understanding of your natural Social Dynamics style, rank the Social Dynamics styles First, decide
				whether your preference for prompting others to act is prescribing or describing. Next, decide whether your natural focus of
				attention in an interaction is an action Focus or a Reflection focus. Based on the combination of these two dynamics, fill in the
				bubble next to the style to which they correspond. For instance, if you have chosen a Prescribing approach to prompting others
				to act and a Reflection Focus for your attention, you would fill in the Mapper bubble.

			  <p>Knowing what the styles share in common can illuminate important sources of connection with others and alternatively,
				what can cause a disconnect. People tend to find it easier to relate to and understand others who share their preferences, and
				harder when they don’t.</p>

				  <p>For example: In a meeting, both Mover’s and Involvers will want a faster pace, more chances to interact and discuss
					things, minimal quiet times and a higher sustained degree of energy. Alternatively, Mappers and Integrators will both
					want opportunities for reflection, a chance to contemplate ideas on their own and moments when there is a calmer
					degree of energy. When it comes to issues around the pacing and energy when discussing an important issue in a
					meeting, you will naturally find alliances between Movers and Involvers on one side, and Mappers and Integrators on
					the other.</p>

				<p>This does not mean that the styles cannot relate to or work well with each other. However, it does show why it is not
				  uncommon that there are particular challenges when they attempt to do so. When they figure it out, the results can be quite
				  powerful.</p>
