<h1>Applications of Social Dynamics at Work</h1>
<div class="row mt-2 mb-3">
  <div class="col-12 mt-3">
	<p>
	  Social Dynamics can assist you in several
	  ways to bridge differences with others to
	  work more effectively and strengthen your
	  relationships. The applications on the
	  following pages are just a few of the many
	  practical ways that understanding and using
	  Social Dynamics can improve your ability to
	  form effective relationships, work
	  productively with others and enjoy work and
	  life even more. Use your knowledge of Social
	  Dynamics and the worksheet below to see how
	  you can shift perspectives and bridge your
	  differences with another individual.
	</p>

	<p>
	  Knowing what the styles share in common can
	  illuminate important sources of connection
	  with others and alternatively, what can
	  cause a disconnect. People tend to find it
	  easier to relate to and understand others
	  who share their preferences, and harder when
	  they don’t.
	</p>

	<div class="border-snapshots-box border-2 rounded mb-4 mt-4">

		For example: In a meeting, both Mover’s
		and Involvers will want a faster pace,
		more chances to interact and discuss
		things, minimal quiet times and a higher
		sustained degree of energy. Alternatively,
		Mappers and Integrators will both want
		opportunities for reflection, a chance to
		contemplate ideas on their own and moments
		when there is a calmer degree of energy.
		When it comes to issues around the pacing
		and energy when discussing an important
		issue in a meeting, you will naturally
		find alliances between Movers and
		Involvers on one side, and Mappers and
		Integrators on the other.
	  </p>
	</div>

	<p>
	  This does not mean that the styles cannot
	  relate to or work well with each other.
	  However, it does show why it is not uncommon
	  that there are particular challenges when
	  they attempt to do so. When they figure it
	  out, the results can be quite powerful.

	<p>Social Dynamics Styles can help you enhance your capacity for working more productively with others in several ways. This
	  workshop will equip you to appreciate the perspectives and approaches to things that differ from yours and actively
	  incorporate them into your team’s work. You will also learn how to look for opportunities and roles that allow you to deploy
	  your natural strengths for the benefit of the team. A third thing you’ll discover is how to adapt your interpersonal
	  communication to the preferences of others, enhancing mutual understanding, cooperation, problem-solving and other
	  aspects of teamwork.</p>

	<h2 class="heading-inner-comman">Using Social Dynamics for More Productive Conflict</h2>
	<p class="mt-3">Although most of us have a negative perception of it, conflict is simply the presence of differences concerning something that
	  matters to the parties involved. It is inevitable in working relationships. It is actually valuable—if handled productively. Research
	  by Dr. Linda Hill of Harvard Business School demonstrates that it is indispensable for innovation. Unfortunately, conflict often
	  leads to misunderstandings, hurt feelings, lack of trust and ineffective working relationships.</p>
	
	<p>There can be many sources of differences that engender conflict at work—differing roles, past experiences, time pressures,
	  stress and more. A key source is differences in personality. This is where Social Dynamics Styles can provide valuable benefits.
	  This workshop will help you learn about common sources of conflict between Styles, typical approaches that each Style uses in
	  dealing with disagreements, specific methods for increasing mutual understanding and ways to use differences for improved
	  idea generation and problem solving.</p>
