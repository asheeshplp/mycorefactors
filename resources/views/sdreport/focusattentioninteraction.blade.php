		<h1>Focus of Attention in an Interaction: Reflection and Action</h1>

		<div class="row mt-2 mb-3">
		  <div class="col-12 mt-3">
			  <p>
				There are two basic directions in which people can focus their attention during an interaction. One is an Action Focus towards
				the world outside of oneself—actions of other people, activities that are happening around you, or what others are saying. The
				other is a Reflection Focus toward the world inside you—your own thoughts, feelings and reflections. Differences in these
				attentional focuses reveal themselves during the pacing of an interaction, the manner in which you clarify your thinking, the
				amount of talking versus silence you prefer, and your level of non-verbal expressiveness.

				  <div class="text-black border-snapshots-box box-snapshot-bg mb-4">
					<p class="fw-semibold mb-0 py-3"><i>We all use some combination of both approaches in our interactions with others. However, we tend to use one more than
					  the other—particularly when acting spontaneously or under stress.</i></p>                                       
				  </div>
				  <p>How might these two different Focuses of Attention look in a specific situation?</p>

				  <div class="border-snapshots-box border-2 rounded">
					<p>Let’s say that you are a front-line employee in an organization. Many members of your department have been
					  experiencing a fair degree of low morale and apathy for some time. You were asked to join a project team tasked with
					  the responsibility of bringing a list of key recommendations to the department manager that will boost the level of
					  morale, create a positive climate, and make the department a more enjoyable place to work. This is your first meeting.
					  No departmental managers are present.</p>
					<p>Your first meeting will be focusing on discussing the possible causes of this widespread discontent. You arrived five
					  minutes before the meeting is scheduled to begin. A few other employees (none of whom you have met before) are
					  already there. Consider the following questions:</p>
					<ul class="list-disc">
					  <li>What would you naturally do during the time you are waiting for the meeting to begin?</li>
					  <li>As the meeting progresses, how would you prefer to process the ideas that are being offered as possible causes
						of the lack of morale?</li>
					</ul>

			<h4>What did you see yourself doing during the five minutes before the meeting began?</h4>
			<ul class="list-disc mt-3">
			  <li>Did you imagine yourself initiating conversations with your colleagues? (Action Focus)</li>
			  <li>Did you picture yourself jumping in and helping get the room set up (flip charts, markers and moving chairs and
				tables? (Action Focus)</li>
			  <li>Maybe you saw yourself going over the notes you had made prior to the meeting, responding if someone spoke to
				you, but quite comfortable sitting quietly? (Refection Focus)</li>
			  <li>You may have envisioned yourself putting down some of your thoughts on paper about the possible causes of low
				morale. (Reflection Focus)</li>
			</ul>
		  </div>

		  <div id="how-yourself-processing">
			<h4>How did you see yourself processing the ideas that were being suggested during the
			  meeting?</h4>
			<ul class="list-disc mt-3">
			  <li>Were you verbally discussing the ideas back and forth with the others in a fast-paced manner? (Action Focus)</li>
			  <li>Were you brainstorming with others trying to build on the suggestions? (Action Focus)</li>
			  <li>Were you contemplating the ideas that were proposed, responding only when you were clear on your idea?
				(Refection Focus)</li>
			  <li>Did you see yourself taking the ideas that surfaced during the meeting and mulling them over in your mind
				afterwards? (Reflection Focus)</li>
			</ul>

			<p>Until people are aware of the two Focuses of Attention, they often don’t realize that they are drawn to one of these quite
			  consistently. Unfortunately, when two people who have opposite focuses are interacting with each other, they can easily
			  misunderstand or be annoyed by the other.</p>
			<p>The diagram below shows what the Social Dynamics styles share in common regarding Focus of Attention. Movers and
			  Involvers both prefer an Action Focus. Mappers and Integrators prefer a Reflection Focus.</p>
