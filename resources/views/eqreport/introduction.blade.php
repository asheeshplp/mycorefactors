<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Emotional Intelligence (EQ) is viewed as an essential capability of individuals seeking to lead and manage others, and for personal effectiveness and well-being. From the first scientific study (The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals, Darwin) to current behavioral and neuroscience studies (see the references at the end of the report), the role of emotions in our well-being and work relationships is staggering. Essentially, emotional intelligence is â€œthe capacity to be aware of, control, and express one's emotions, and to handle interpersonal relationships judiciously and empathetically.</p>
<p> In many ways, our emotions are our first language. We had emotions before we had words. From our earliest awareness, our emotions were demonstrated through body and facial expressions. As we grew older, we learned some basic words to label our emotions, and now as adults, we know that understanding and managing our emotions are essential skills to be successful at home and on the job. Emotions are the energy threads that run through all human experience.</p>
<p> Based on decades of research, all forms of intelligence are reflective of our capacities to perceive and judge or manage, both our individual reactions and the circumstances in front of us. Emotional intelligence is no different. We must make sure and polish those skills that help make our perceptions clear and our judgments sounder as it relates to identifying and using our emotional energies. This report provides a WHAT, SO WHAT, and NOW WHAT approach to enriching your EQ. WHAT is about the specifics of your rating. SO WHAT is about clarifying which competencies are most important to work on. NOW WHAT is the purpose of the action tips designed to guide you going forward.</p>
