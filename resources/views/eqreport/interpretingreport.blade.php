<h3>Interpreting Your Report</h3>
<p>The goal of any interpretation is to provide clarity with the data and focus on those development areas that will benefit you the most. You have four kinds of information to consider when interpreting your report: Dimension Scores, Effectiveness and Importance Scores, and Gap Scores. It is essential that you look at themes and patterns in your scores, identifying those areas that appear to be strengths and areas needing attention.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that all of your behaviors are influenced by your family of origin, culture, situational pressures, previous lessons learned, and dispositions---what you came into the world with such as tendencies and traits. When you are considering the nature and aspects of your behavior, keep in mind that each is complex and malleable—you can adjust.</p>

<div class="score-comman eq-interpreting">
<div id ="domain-scores">
<h2>Domain Scores</h2>
<p>Your Domain score is the addition of each of the ten EQ skill scores you provided. The ten EQ skills are summed for both Effectiveness and Importance such that the lowest score is 10 and the highest score is 70. The averages provided by the norm group allow for an immediate comparison of how similar or dissimilar your reported scores are to a similar adult group. The Interpretative note is based on your scores falling within certain ranges as allowed by the standard deviations in the norm group—or average differences. So, if your score is within the typical range of most adults, your interpretative comment will provide one kind of guidance, and if higher or lower by a standard deviation from the typical adult group, you receive another interpretative comment</p>
<p>While it is likely that those Domains with the highest or lowest scores will reflect the higher or lower specific EQ skills, that may not always be true. For example, if your highest Domain is Self-Awareness there may be several EQ skills in that domain with lower Effectiveness or Importance scores. Overall scores that the Domains provide tell us “the way the wind is blowing.” The specific EQ skills scores give clues as to “how strong the winds are.”</p>
<p>A quick guide is as follows:</p>

<h3>Effectiveness Scores</h3>
<p>Look at each of your EQ Skill Effectiveness Scores in each Domain. Are there particular patterns that emerge in each Domain and across Domains? For example, are the self-ratings generally the same in each Domain or are there variations where you scored a 4 and others a 7?</p>
<p>In cases where you gave essentially the same rating for each skill, consider how to verify how reflective this may be of experience or things learned over time in this Domain. And depending on how Important a particular skill may be, you may want to consider ways to enrich or deepen that skill. In cases with score variations such as a 4 and 7 in a domain, reflect on how experience and feedback (or lack thereof) have played into how these skills are demonstrated.</p>
<p>Moderately or lower-rated EQ Skills may need to be further developed, depending on relative importance at this time.</p>
</div>
<div id ="importance-scores">
<h4>Importance Scores</h4>
<p>Look at your EQ Skill Importance Scores in each Domain. Are there particular patterns that emerge in each Domain and across Domains? While the guidelines for interpreting the Effectiveness scores are similar, the difference is that you are indicating how Important a skill may be, and as such need to consider why a particular skill is Important now and may be in the future.</p>
<p>Moderately or lower-rated Importance with EQ Skills may need to be explored and others’ feedback examined to determine the relative value of this skill for you now.</p>
</div>
<div id="gap-scores">
<h5>Gap Scores</h5>
<p>Absolute Gap Scores are reported. It does not matter if the Effectiveness Score is higher or the Importance Score is higher, a “Gap” is the difference between the two self-ratings. If the Importance score is higher, it becomes more valuable to explore why this may be true. Only those Gap Scores that are high and the Importance rating is higher than the Effectiveness Score, will the system highlight the skill. The action tips provided at the end of the report are ONLY for those highlighted skills.</p>
<p>If you feel you are very Effective at a skill that may not be Important right now, consider that “money in the bank.” When you need that skill in the future, you are relatively ready to demonstrate it.</p>
<p>A quick guide is as follows (1-2 is Low; 3-5 is Moderate; 6-7 is High):</p>

<p>Because the EQ Skills have been evaluated for complexity, degree of exposure required to learn, cognitive and emotional components, and contribution of disposition, some are more powerful than others in their contribution to emotional intelligence. The EQ Skills have been listed in each Domain in terms of power, with the most challenging listed first and least challenging to develop last.</p>
<p>Whenever there is a Gap Score tie between EQ Skills, the skill that is more powerful and comprehensive in its contribution to emotional intelligence is highlighted. Otherwise, the skill with the greatest Gap Score when the Importance is rated higher than Effectiveness is highlighted.</p>
<p>A star (*) denotes that Effectiveness was rated higher than Importance, suggesting this particular behavior may be adequate for the current situation. It is a good idea to get additional feedback about your behavior to confirm how effective you are at demonstrating a particular skill. You can ask someone who knows you well a simple question like, “Tell me about a time when you saw me do…" These EQ skills are like having money in a savings account.</p>
