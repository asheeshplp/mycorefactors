						  <h3>Understanding Self-Report</h3>
                              <p>Whenever we provide a self-report, we have to be mindful that what we believe to be true of ourselves needs to be confirmed by checking out how others perceive we are doing, especially on behaviors that are considered really important. Seeking additional data on how your behavior is observed is really important to becoming more self-aware and more effective in dealing with others. A practical action you can take is to share your report with others, or aspects of your report, and ask simply how they perceive you demonstrating these behaviors.</p>
                              <p>Self-report is essentially a self-portrait. We are declaring that this is how we see ourselves based on the “colors” and “forms” we have selected, which in this case are behaviors and mindsets we believe about ourselves as expressed through forty specific EQ competencies. This is a beginning of exploration, not an end. Things that may be important today, may not be so in the next six months. What is true is that these forty competencies are of importance at some time in your career and personal life and the more you know, the greater chance you have at overall well-being and satisfaction.</p>
                              <p>You were asked to indicate the degree to which various behaviors are important to your success and how effective you feel you demonstrate the behavior. The rating scales are as follows:</p>
                              <div id="effectivenessTab">
                              <h4>Effectiveness</h4>
                              <p>You calibrated Effectiveness using the following scale:</p>
