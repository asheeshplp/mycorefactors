                                    <p class="m-0-important">Individuals preferring ENFP are consistently drawn to the outer world of new ideas and possibilities that are the basis for work and play. They see so many possible projects and aspects of situations that they may labor over which one to tackle first. They formulate novel approaches to old problems and efficient solutions to project issues through brainstorming. These individuals have skill and sensitivity in dealing with the concerns of others and will attempt to understand what needs to occur to keep or get things on track. They find too much detail a struggle to integrate rapidly into their conceptualization process and may glaze over if pushed for answers too quickly. When experiencing stress, they can become confused with what is essential to focus upon and act irrationally toward those who question their competency and abilities.</p>
