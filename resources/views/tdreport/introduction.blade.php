	<h3>Introduction</h3>
	<p>The Core Factors Type Discovery assessment is designed to help facilitate your
	  learning valuable information about how you direct your energy, take in information,
	  make decisions, and orient to your environment. This information reveals how your
	  personality contributes to many aspects of life, including your learning style, work/
	  activity, and leadership.</p>
	<p>Psychological type theory can help you understand why some situations are enjoyable
	  and energizing while others are uncomfortable and draining. The assessment is
	  intended to help you in the process of self-understanding and personal and
	  professional growth.</p>

	  <p><strong><i>Note:</i></strong> The assessment should always be used with other self-exploration methods to
		establish which personality type is accurate for you. It is recommended that you verify
		your reported results through feedback and interaction with a person knowledgeable
		about psychological type.</p>
