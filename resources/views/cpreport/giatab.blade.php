		  experiences throughout your life. The patterns provide understanding for the way you interact with many of your work and
		  leisure situations. Read the following descriptions and consider how each GIA fits you and others in your work, home and
		  leisure environments. Attempt to recognize how these patterns reveal instances of conflict and/or harmony, with individuals
