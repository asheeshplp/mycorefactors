			day-to-day and/or long-range processes of operating an organization or unit (division or section of an
			organization). They may include but are not limited to managing a private business, corporation executives,
			and leadership roles in civic organizations and projects. Common tasks and activities include oversight of
			procedures and activities necessary to carry out the mission and vision of the organization. There tends to be
			frequent if not continuous, direct involvement with individuals as well as a high level of responsibility for
			success. The environment in which these tasks are performed is typically an inside office facility, yet may
			involve frequent travel and meetings in other environments. Individuals preferring this area are typically
			comfortable making decisions that affect the lives and future of others.</p>

	  frequently performed is physically large. It may be outdoors, industrial, or factory-like settings. People
	  preferring this area of tasks and activities will typically be successful at designing and producing tangible

	from quiet, isolated production of fine artistic (painting, sculpting, writing) works to group performance in
	front of large audiences or a deep appreciation of any artistic pursuit. Central to all tasks and activities in this
	area is the desire to produce and create something new and different that is typically shared with others.
	There is a wide range of artistic medium production, from purely mental, as in writing, to physical, as in
	performing arts (ballet). There is an equally wide range of environments, from quiet and serene to crowded
	and chaotic.</p>

  <p>This area of task and activity is involved with serving the needs and desires of others in groups or teams. A
	common theme in this area is the experience of being part of a collection of individuals with a common
	purpose or goal. It may involve one individual serving a group or a group serving an individual. In either case,
	it is not typically a singular or one-on-one activity. Because of the consistent group activity, most occupations
	associated with this area involve physical activity and verbal interaction. The environments in which these
	activities occur may range from an office-type space to an out of doors athletic field.</p>

	involve interactions with smaller numbers of people or family units and require reflective and creative
	thought. Further, there is frequent involvement with building or making something in a natural setting.
	Central to this area is a desire to be involved in a more native or natural environment, including oneâ€™s home.</p>

<div class="d-flex justify-content-between gap-5 align-items-center">
  <p>Individual/Personal Service Tasks and Activities focus on you, the individual, serving the needs and desires of
	others. These individuals obtain information from others and apply knowledge and understanding to that
	information to provide meaningful help and service. These tasks and activities often occur in quieter
	surroundings with only one or two other individuals present. Although providing service for someone may
	occur in any setting, it is frequently done in office settings, with scheduled activities and a quiet, comfortable
	setting.

  <p>Government Service Tasks and Activities represent a variety of occupations within the structure and
	organization of a governmental organization or body. The most common element of this area is the existence
	of a highly structured organization unit where clear guidelines describe all of the tasks and activities, and the
	chain of authority is articulated and promoted as part of the structure itself. There is very little ambiguity or
	flexibility within this areaâ€™s occupations regarding what tasks and activities an individual will perform. People
	who prefer governmental service tasks and activities will find themselves in environments that range from
	office buildings to police cars. </p>
