                              <p>Consider the Occupational Activity Groupings (OAG) areas that are a part of the occupations you listed or that match your code.
                                Check your OAG results to see which areas in those occupations seem to fit you the most. The process should be repeated and
                                refined, ensuring that when you match an occupation with the code, you check the OAG for potential areas of Avoidance that
                                may result in being uncomfortable if you choose that occupation.</p>

                                <p>As you take the next step on your career exploration, spend time researching the final set of occupations you listed above and
                                  learn more about the tasks/activities and environments in which they occur. This will allow you to continue to refine your career
                                  choices. The more you explore your natural preferences and interests, the more conscious and aware your career decisions will
                                  be. The more work you put into this process, the greater your chance of a satisfying and productive career.</p>
